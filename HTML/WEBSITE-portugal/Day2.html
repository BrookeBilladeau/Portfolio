    <h1>Day 2: Now onto Sintra (W:5/22)</h1>
    <img src="Sintra.png" alt="Sintra"/>
    <p>This is the Day we go to <strong>Sintra</strong> and the surrounding region! My first stop would be Rossio Square in Lisbon, which is a large public area in the Biaxa district that many interesting statues, and more importantly, has the train to Sintra, a city on the coast that has many beautiful castles and is a <abbr>UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage Site. This city is on the border of the Parque Natural de Sintra-Cascais, a large mountainous national park with hiking trails and castles nestled in the trees. There are many cheap tours to go on, many hiking trails to explore, and many ancient castles to see. My plan for Sintra is to just explore and do whatever I feel like, after checking into my hostel of course!</p>
