  <p> For our 9th Day of Adventure, we say goodbye to <strong>Evora</strong>, and head back to <strong>Lisbon</strong>, the final city on our Portugal backpacking adventure. After the train back, I plan to spend the rest of the day exploring the sites and museums within district of Lisbon known as "The Modern City". This district is very large and the attractions are spread out a bit more, but I'm using the day as a relaxed day to rest or wander.</p>

  <p>For my last full day in Portugal, I saved the best <strong>Lisbon</strong> attraction for last! I'm going to spend the whole day at the Lisbon Oceanarium! It's supposedly one of the best in the world and my guidebook says it may be an all day adventure. If not, other attractions are a short tram ride away. I can't wait for this day, even if it will be bittersweet. Day 10 will then end with me going to the airport to sleep for a few hours before I wake up on Friday Day 11 for my 6am flight. A quick stopover in <strong>Munich, Germany</strong>, a long plane ride to <strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>, and then a final hop to <strong>Minneapolis</strong> airport concludes my first Solo Backpacking Adventure to Portugal. </p>
