  <p>This is the point I haven't actually planned past yet. I do have a general outline.
  I leave <strong>Porto for Braga</strong>, a town that houses mainly historic religious sights. The Bom Jesus do Monte is a popular attraction for many people, religious or not, so I hope to see that. I plan to spend the first half of the day here, then hop a quick train to the nearby old, medieval town of <strong>Guimaraes</strong>. Not only was the Guimaraes Historic Center yet another <abbr>UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage Site, but the town also served as the European Capital of Culture in 2012. The site I most wish to see in this city is Castelo de Guimaraes. I plan to use any remaining time in the day to explore many of the other attractions, but at this time, I have no concrete plans. This is also the city I stop for the night in.</p>
